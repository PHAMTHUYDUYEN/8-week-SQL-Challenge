###  1. How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)
```SQL
SELECT
    TO_CHAR(registration_date, 'WW') AS week,
    COUNT(runner_id) AS total_registered_runners
FROM runners
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```
| week | total_registered_runners |
| ---- | ------------------------ |
| 01   | 2                        |
| 02   | 1                        |
| 03   | 1                        |

---
###  2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?
```SQL
WITH unique_ord AS(
	SELECT
      order_id,
      customer_id,
      MAX(order_time) AS order_time
	FROM cln_co
	GROUP BY 1,2)

SELECT
    r.runner_id,
    AVG(DATE_PART('min', r.pickup_time - c.order_time)) AS avg_pickup_duration    
FROM cln_ro AS r 
	JOIN unique_ord AS c 
  USING(order_id)
WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```
| runner_id | avg_pickup_duration |
| --------- | ------------------- |
| 1         | 14                  |
| 2         | 19.666666666666668  |
| 3         | 10                  |

---
###  3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?
```SQL
 WITH raw_data AS(    
   SELECT
      order_id,
      COUNT(c.pizza_id) AS total_pizzas,
      AVG(EXTRACT(min FROM (r.pickup_time - c.order_time))) AS prep_time
   FROM cln_ro AS r 
      JOIN cln_co AS c USING(order_id)
   WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL
   GROUP BY 1
   ORDER BY 1)
 
SELECT 
    CORR(total_pizzas, prep_time) AS correlation
FROM raw_data
```
| correlation        |
| ------------------ |
| 0.8372508882083807 |

- The figure 0.837 indicates a strong correlation: the number of pizzas in an order significantly affects the preparation time.
- However, other factors may also impact preparation time, such as kitchen productivity or the type of pizza.
- If Danny's restaurant wants to reduce waiting time, it could consider optimizing the production process for orders with more pizzas (breaking down the process, assigning each person a specific task; forecasting peak orders, improving employee skills, and investing in technology and equipment).

###  4. What was the average distance travelled for each customer?
```SQL
 SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    ROUND(AVG(r.distance_km),2) AS avg_distance_km
 FROM cln_ro AS r 
    JOIN cln_co AS c USING(order_id)
 WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL
 GROUP BY 1
 ORDER BY 1
```
| customer_id | avg_distance_km |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| 101         | 20.00           |
| 102         | 16.73           |
| 103         | 23.40           |
| 104         | 10.00           |
| 105         | 25.00           |
---
###  5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?
```SQL
 SELECT
	MAX(duration_mins) - MIN(duration_mins) AS duration_diff
 FROM cln_ro 
 WHERE cancellation IS NULL
```
| duration_diff |
| ------------- |
| 30            |

---
###  6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?
```SQL
 SELECT
    order_id,
    runner_id,
    ROUND(distance_km/NULLIF((duration_mins/60),0),2) AS avg_speed
 FROM cln_ro 
 WHERE cancellation IS NULL
 ORDER BY 2,1 ASC
```
| order_id | runner_id | avg_speed |
| -------- | --------- | --------- |
| 1        | 1         | 37.50     |
| 2        | 1         | 44.44     |
| 3        | 1         | 40.20     |
| 10       | 1         | 60.00     |
| 4        | 2         | 35.10     |
| 7        | 2         | 60.00     |
| 8        | 2         | 93.60     |
| 5        | 3         | 40.00     |

- Runners are getting faster over time.
  - Runner 1: 37.50 ‚Üí 44.44 ‚Üí 40.20 ‚Üí 60.00 (increasing trend)
  - Runner 2: 35.10 ‚Üí 60.00 ‚Üí 93.60 (significant increase)

- Runner 2's significantly higher maximum speed (93 km/h, while the other two runners have speeds below 60 km/h), this could indicate:
  - A data entry issue for order 8
  - A scenario where the runner used a car instead of a bicycle
  - A very favorable condition (long straight road, no stops, etc.)

###  7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?
```SQL
 SELECT
    runner_id,
    ROUND(COUNT(duration_mins)*100 / COUNT(order_id),2) AS successful_delivery_percentage
 FROM cln_ro 
 GROUP BY 1
```
| runner_id | successful_delivery_percentage |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| 3         | 50.00                          |
| 2         | 75.00                          |
| 1         | 100.00                         |

**Note**: The successful delivery percentage did not fully represent the runners' performance due to cancellation orders, which are made by either customers or restaurant.
