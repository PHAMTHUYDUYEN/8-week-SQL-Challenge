SELECT
    n.pizza_name,
    STRING_AGG(t.topping_name,',') AS standard_ingredients
FROM splt_pz AS p
	JOIN pizza_toppings AS t  USING(topping_id)
  JOIN pizza_names AS n  USING(pizza_id)
GROUP BY 1
```
| pizza_name | standard_ingredients                                                                                           |
