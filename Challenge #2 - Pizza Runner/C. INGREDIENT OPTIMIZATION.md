## Case Study Questions

1. What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?
2. What was the most commonly added extra?

  - Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers
5. Generate an alphabetically ordered comma separated ingredient list for each pizza order from the customer_orders table and add a 2x in front of any relevant ingredients. For example: "Meat Lovers: 2xBacon, Beef, ... , Salami"
6. What is the total quantity of each ingredient used in all delivered pizzas sorted by most frequent first?

### 1. What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?
```SQL
WITH splt_pz AS(
  SELECT
      pizza_id,
      UNNEST(string_to_array(toppings, ','))::INT AS topping_id
  FROM pizza_recipes)

SELECT
    n.pizza_name,
    STRING_AGG(t.topping_name,', ') AS standard_ingredients
FROM splt_pz AS p
    JOIN pizza_toppings AS t   USING(topping_id)
    JOIN pizza_names AS n   USING(pizza_id)
GROUP BY 1
```
| pizza_name | standard_ingredients                                           |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Meatlovers | BBQ Sauce, Pepperoni, Cheese, Salami, Chicken, Bacon, Mushrooms, Beef |
| Vegetarian | Tomato Sauce, Cheese, Mushrooms, Onions, Peppers, Tomatoes          |

### 2. What was the most commonly added extra?
```SQL
SELECT
    pizza_toppings.topping_name,
    COUNT(union_extra.pizza_id) AS total_add
FROM (
      SELECT pizza_id, extra1 AS extra FROM cln_co
      UNION ALL
      SELECT pizza_id, extra2 AS extra FROM cln_co) AS union_extra
  JOIN pizza_toppings ON union_extra.extra = pizza_toppings.topping_id
WHERE extra IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```
| topping_name | total_add |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Bacon        | 4         |
| Chicken      | 1         |
| Cheese       | 1         |

### 3. What was the most common exclusion?
```SQL
SELECT
    pizza_toppings.topping_name,
    COUNT(union_exclusion.pizza_id) AS total_exclusion
FROM (
      SELECT pizza_id, exclusion1 AS exclusion FROM cln_co
      UNION ALL
      SELECT pizza_id, exclusion2 AS exclusion FROM cln_co) AS union_exclusion
  JOIN pizza_toppings ON union_exclusion.exclusion = pizza_toppings.topping_id
WHERE exclusion IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```
| topping_name | total_exclusion |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Cheese       | 4               |
| Mushrooms    | 1               |
| BBQ Sauce    | 1               |
